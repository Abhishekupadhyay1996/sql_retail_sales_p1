FROM sqlproject1.retail  
GROUP BY year, month  
ORDER BY year, month;

SELECT   
  category,  
  SUM(total\_sale) AS total\_sales  
FROM sqlproject1.retail  
GROUP BY category  
ORDER BY total\_sales DESC;

#### **‚è∞ Identifying Peak Sales Hours**

SELECT   
  CASE   
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale\_time) \< 12 THEN 'Morning'  
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale\_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 16 THEN 'Afternoon'

#### **üéØ Customer Segmentation Based on Demographics**

SELECT   
  gender,  
  AVG(age) AS avg\_age,  
  SUM(total\_sale) AS total\_sales  
FROM sqlproject1.retail  
GROUP BY gender  
ORDER BY total\_sales DESC;

#### **üèÜ Highest Monthly Average Sales**

WITH ranked\_sales AS (  
  SELECT   
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale\_date) AS year,  
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale\_date) AS month,  
    ROUND(AVG(total\_sale), 2\) AS average\_sale,  
    DENSE\_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale\_date) ORDER BY AVG(total\_sale) DESC) AS rank  
  FROM sqlproject1.retail  
  GROUP BY year, month  
)  
SELECT \*  
FROM ranked\_sales  
WHERE rank \= 1;

#### **üìå Transactions with Clothing Sales Over 3 Units in Nov-2022**

SELECT   
 transactions\_id,  
 category,  
 quantity,  
 sale\_date  
FROM sqlproject1.retail  
WHERE category \= 'Clothing'  
AND quantity \> 3  
AND sale\_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';

#### **üè∑Ô∏è Total Sales by Category**

SELECT   
  category,  
  SUM(total\_sale) AS net\_sale  
FROM sqlproject1.retail  
GROUP BY category;

#### **üìâ Average Total Sales by Month & Year**

SELECT   
  year,  
  month,  
  ROUND(AVG(total\_sale), 2\) AS average\_sale  
FROM sqlproject1.retail  
GROUP BY year, month;

#### **üåÖ Sales Distribution by Time of Day**

WITH shift AS (  
  SELECT   
    CASE   
      WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale\_time) \<= 12 THEN 'Morning'  
      WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale\_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'  
      ELSE 'Evening'  
    END AS shift,  
    quantity  
  FROM sqlproject1.retail  
)  
SELECT   
  shift,  
  SUM(quantity) AS num\_orders  
FROM shift  
GROUP BY shift;

## **üîç Findings**

* **Most sales occur in the Afternoon shift**, with evenings showing moderate activity.

* **Certain categories (e.g., Clothing, Electronics) drive the majority of revenue**.

* **Customer demographics influence purchasing behavior**, with variations in spending across age groups and genders.

* **Highest monthly sales vary each year, with some months outperforming others consistently**.

* **Transactions involving clothing with high quantity purchases are limited but impactful in revenue generation**.

## **üéØ Conclusion**

By analyzing the retail sales data, businesses can optimize inventory, target promotions based on peak sales hours, and develop personalized marketing strategies. SQL is a powerful tool for gaining actionable insights from structured datasets.
